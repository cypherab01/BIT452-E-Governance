### Unit 5: Applications of Data Warehousing and Data Mining in Government

#### 1. Introduction

-   **Data Warehousing**:

    -   **Definition**: Involves collecting, storing, and managing data from various sources in a centralized repository called a data warehouse.
    -   **Purpose**: Provides a consolidated platform for reporting and data analysis, serving as a reliable source of historical and current data.
    -   **Characteristics**:
        -   **Subject-Oriented**: Organized around subjects like sales, finance, or citizen data.
        -   **Integrated**: Combines data from different sources into a consistent format.
        -   **Time-Variant**: Stores historical data for trend analysis.
        -   **Non-volatile**: Data remains unchanged once stored, ensuring a stable record.
    -   **Example**: Nepal’s government could use a data warehouse to store citizen data for tax analysis.

-   **Data Mining**:

    -   **Definition**: The process of discovering patterns, trends, and insights from large datasets using techniques like statistical analysis, machine learning, and AI.
    -   **Purpose**: Extracts valuable knowledge to uncover hidden relationships and support predictions or classifications.
    -   **Techniques**:
        -   **Classification**: Assigns items to predefined categories (e.g., identifying eligible beneficiaries).
        -   **Clustering**: Groups similar items based on features.
        -   **Association Rule Mining**: Finds relationships between variables (e.g., correlating services used).
        -   **Regression Analysis**: Predicts numerical values (e.g., forecasting budget needs).
        -   **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers (e.g., detecting fraud).
    -   **Example**: Nepal’s e-procurement system uses data mining to detect fraudulent bids.

-   **Relationship between Data Warehousing and Data Mining**:
    -   Data mining uses data stored in a warehouse for pattern discovery.
    -   Warehouses provide reliable, integrated data for training and validating mining models.
    -   **Example**: Nepal’s Smart Nagarpalika uses a data warehouse to store tax data, mined for payment trends.

#### 2. National Data Warehouses

        -   Uses clustering, classification, and predictive modeling for insights.
        -   Supports spatial analysis with geographic data (e.g., ZIP codes).
        -   **Example**: Nepal mines census data to predict population growth in rural areas.
    -   **Historical Analysis**:
        -   Stores decades of data for trend analysis (e.g., population distribution changes).
        -   **Example**: Nepal analyzes historical census data to plan urban development.

-   **Prices of Essential Commodities**:
    -   **Definition**: Costs of goods and services necessary for daily living (e.g., food, housing, energy).
    -   **Role of Data Warehousing**:
        -   Stores historical pricing data across regions and time periods.
        -   Integrates data from suppliers and markets.
